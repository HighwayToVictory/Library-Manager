# Library-Manager

Using C programming language to create a library manager.

## Why do we learn these subjects ?
**Structs** are an important part of c programming language.<br />
We need to work with structs in the first place in order to to some advanced projects with C.<br />

Learn more about structs in [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/structures-c/)

Another important tool in programming is **string**.<br />
It's important to know how to work with strings in c programming language.
